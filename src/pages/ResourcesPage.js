            <h2>Letter of Recommendation </h2>
            <p><strong>Information for students:</strong> If a program requires a letter of recommendation from a professional, choose someone who knows you well and can positively reflect on your qualities. You should also notify them at least two weeks in advance.</p>
            <p><strong>Information for teachers/professionals:</strong> A letter of recommendation is a letter that vouches for the student’s educational or professional performance. Most programs have specific questions they would like you to answer. If you have not written a letter of recommendation before, I have included a link below that shows you an ideal example of letter of recommendation. </p>

                <p><strong>What is your favorite subject at school and why?</strong></p>
                <p>Physics is my favorite subject. It is so pertinent in my daily life. It affects us everyday and is the core of our reality. It isn't as abstract as mathematics, and I've found it to be satisfying to find a conclusion to a problem. Then, I read more about it. I admire how much scientists like Einstein claimed the one sentence most people refused to say, "I don't know". It was an eye opening experience for me, because in a world where people hate to be wrong or pretend like they know everything, scientists swim against that current. Additionally, I've always been quite curious about the 'why' in life and physics helps me answer that 'why'. I love that we don't have to memorise physics only to forget it over the next few days. Its concept pushes me to understand physics. Science is not just dealing with far fetched theories and solving hypotheticals, it's about truth. Galileo Galilei, a firm believer in the truth, died in the name of the truth rather than living a lie. Knowledge is the light I find in the darkness.</p>
                <p>2020 has been a challenging year for Sudan and the rest of the world. Describe a local or global social justice issue that has been prominent this year. Explain its significance to you and the steps that could have been taken to identify a solution.</p>
                <p>In mid March of 2020, Egypt tried to aggressively suppress the number of positive Covid-19 cases by underreporting in order to avoid an economical backlash from tourism decline. This posed a major challenge, because the lack of accurate estimates makes it difficult to distinguish severe and critical situations and to take effective measures. The first cases in Africa are presumed to have occured in Egypt. It would've been less inconvenient had Egypt taken the right action by giving correct numerical estimates. Educating people on precautions would be the best solution. Also, we can debunk myths of the disease from fake news that surface on the internet by providing the public with true, scientifically supported methods such as: wearing masks, washing your hands, using sanitizer and keeping a distance.</p>
                <p><strong>Tell us about a time when you had to do something that wasn't aligned with your values or beliefs and what you took from that experience.</strong></p>
                <p>Everyone is told not to lie. It's sinful to lie. It's immoral to lie. And for a long time I believed that to be true. I've met many people in my life that say something then do something else. When you ask them what is their core value, they say it's honesty, but only to lie whenever it's convenient for them. I've always had a black or white perspective. I've found that being honest was a less complicated route to embark on. But I've learned that the truth could be more damaging than lies. It all depends on intention. There's a difference between complimenting a friend's shirt that you might not like to boost their confidence and complimenting them because you want to look better in comparison. The former is a white lie and the latter is deception that elevates self-interests. I've learned to follow my moral instinct when it alludes to a fruitful outcome. If it causes more harm than good, I take a different route towards a better conclusion.</p>
                <p><strong>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</strong></p>
                <p>I've always been introverted, so public speaking has been a nightmare for me. I was rather glad to find out that many people share my dread for public speaking. It made me feel less awkward. I come from a society, where people think there is something severely wrong with you if you aren't outgoing. While I am doing significantly better now as I'm growing up, thanks to the debate programs I participate in, it's something that I haven't quite yet overcome but I am doing my best. My strength is putting my utmost effort into tasks. Whenever I am assigned a project that I am not entirely engrossed in, I never downgrade my performance. Instead, I always apply myself to the best of my ability. When I was in grade 10, we had an engineering assignment that required us to build a circuit. Electricity isn't my field of expertise, so I wasn’t pleased. However, I spent 1 week gathering the best equipment I could find and with much trial and error, I made a project I'm still proud of.</p>
                <p><strong>Tell me about a time you made a mistake</strong></p>
                <p>In 7th grade, we had a group science project. I wasn't too keen on the idea of working with a team, muchless, a team I didn't particularly pick to be a part of. We decided to demonstrate the solar system and the effect of the sun's gravity on the planets. I was picked to be the leader by my teammates. The other groups each divided the tasks among themselves, while I decided to do everything by myself when my teammates expressed disinterest in the project. When we finished, it dawned on us that everyone would have to present what they contributed to the assignment. With little to no conversation among us, we had a rather awkward presentation. Needless to say, we got last place, but we learned a valuable lesson. My teammates learned to be more involved in a project. I learned to be more cooperative and to encourage others to get involved. I have also learned to ease my perfectionism, which I found hindering. It is an area I'm still working on and learning from.</p>
                <p><strong>What is your community involvement?</strong></p>
                <p>A few years ago, I was watching Harry Potter with my cousin. He turned to me and said, ''You know, you are so lucky to watch this movie without Arabic subtitles". It made me quite upset. I told him I'd teach him and he agreed. We started from scratch to learn English. Witnessing his progress and his will to learn motivated me in return. Then, we started watching English cartoon films together without Arabic subtitles. Cartoons are a great way to understand, because of the exaggerated expressions. He was improving, but he was still self conscious to speak English in public. I told him to gather his friends, so that they can learn with him. I began an English course with his friends, which allowed for more comfortability. His friends, who were planning to travel abroad, were engaged, as well. My time tutoring my cousin and his friends in the language of English and seeing their improvement was rewarding.</p>
