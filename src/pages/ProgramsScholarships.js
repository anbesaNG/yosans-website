            <h2 style={{paddingLeft: "6rem"}}>Duolingo </h2>
            <p>Duolingo is an American language-learning resource providing lessons on more than 30 languages. They have a website and an app (download the app for easy access). It is a great resource to learn English. </p>
            <p>Additionally, Duolingo offers an <a className="unstyled-link" href="https://englishtest.duolingo.com/home">English language test</a>, which you can use as a proof of proficiency. The exam fee is $49. However, they recently partnered with UNHCR and IRC to waive this fee for refugees. I recommend that you inform your school about this opportunity as they can request for funds directly since most Eritrean refugee schools are supported by UNHCR. <a className="unstyled-link" href="https://englishtest.duolingo.com/access">Here is the link for the application.</a></p>
            <p><a className="unstyled-link" href="https://www.ets.org/toefl">Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)</a> also offers an English standardized test to measure your English proficiency, but the cost for the exam is close to $200. </p>
