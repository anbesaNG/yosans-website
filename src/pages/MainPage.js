            <p>Fere (Seed) Project aims to support young Eritrean refugees in Sudan to reach their full potential by connecting them to educational opportunities. The adequate development of a country with a strong institution and just policies depends on current and future young leaders. Supporting young high-achieving students financially or information-wise is a great first step in ensuring African youth will critically challenge issues of equality and social injustice in their community.
