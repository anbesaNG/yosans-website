            <p>Fere Project  aims to expand higher education acceptance and retention in the Eritrean refugee youth population located in Sudan. This website serves as a centralized database of international and domestic opportunities that students might not be aware of.</p>
            <p>For students: Under the resources tab, we have posted information on how to craft your application profile so that you are one of the competitive candidates wherever you choose to apply. We have also posted a few tips on how to prepare for interviews. In addition, we will constantly research and post scholarship opportunities, undergraduate and masters programs that you qualify for.</p>
            <p>For individuals living abroad: Financial burden is one of the main reasons students are not able to continue their studies past high school education. Choosing to sponsor one student would greatly help in tackling this issue. Go to “Support Fere Project” for more information. If there are other scholarships or opportunities we have not posted, please send us an email to inform us. </p>
            <p>This is a small-scale project working on a community level. We hope this instills hope and offers stability in the Eritrean community in Sudan.</p>
