            <p>Due to the humanitarian and political crisis, the majority of Eritreans are forced to flee Eritrea. Since around 2010, the flow of unaccompanied minors from Eritrean has significantly increased, which has become the topic of international concern. Until a few years ago, Eritreans who fled Eritrea moved along four major routes: to Yemen and Saudi Arabia;  through Sudan and Egypt into Israel; through Kenya to South Africa; through Sudan, Libya and Ethiopia before crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Italy. Due to migration restrictions in Israel and conflict with Yemen, the northwest route to Europe has become the viable option. As a result, Sudan has become a host to a large population of international migrants and refugees in addition to internally displaced individuals. It has also become one of the key transit points for those migrating to neighboring countries. 
</p>
            <p>Eritreans were the largest group crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach European countries in 2015, and the second largest after Nigerians in 2016. The journey through Sudan, Libya and Mediterranean Sea poses several dangers and life threats. Every Eritrean interviewed by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) during rescue reported being held in captivity, experiencing severe levels of violence, torture, sexual violence and witnessing death at the hand of smugglers. In addition to physical ailments, MSF reported severe psychological illness in all patients. Eritrean youth are forced to take these journeys from Sudan to Libya due to limited opportunities for stable employment, education and access to service. This issue has been aggravated by the EU and its member states, who are currently strengthening their collaboration with governments such as Eritrean, Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya to control migration in exchange for funds. In addition to externalizing its borders, the EU has deprioritized the development of legal options for refugees to seek safe migration thereby placing hundreds of vulnerable refugees at the hands of smugglers and governments with questionable human rights records. Some of these collaborations led to initiatives that would be effective if implemented. For instance, Ethiopia planned an initiative to improve the lives of refugees by expanding “out of camp” policy, providing work permits, providing farming land for refugees, and improving essential social service for refugees including access to health care. However, governments who received the necessary funds have not materialized these initiatives. This history of migration has a direct detrimental impact on education access, which has negative implications on migrating refugees and the transit countries such as Sudan. </p>
            <p>Better governance in Eritrea and coordinated helpful policy implementation by neighboring countries would be an ideal solution. In the meantime, we will post resources and update available domestic and international opportunities available for Eritrean refugees so that they do not resort to hazards means of leaving Sudan.
